#### Week 3

The folder *R Learning activities* contains some R learning activities we created for week 3 of our [course I](https://www.edx.org/course/statistical-thinking-data-science-columbiax-ds101x) "Statistical Thinking for Data Science and Analytics" for the [ColumbiaX series on Data Science and Analytics](http://datascience.columbia.edu/columbia-and-edx-launch-online-data-science-education-series) on [edX](https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-science-analytics-context). 

##### Before you start

+ Download R (and choose the version according to your computer’s platform) from https://cran.rstudio.com/. 
+ Open (double click) the downloaded package to start standard installation. 
+ Install R studio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/. 
+ Start RStudio.
+ In the lower left “Console” window, type `install.packages(“knitr”)`
+ You will be asked to select a respiratory. Please just choose one that is close to you or just choose “https://cran.rstudio.com/.”

##### Learning activities

- [Learning activity 1](https://github.com/tz33cu/ColumbiaX-Statistical-Thinking-for-Data-Science/blob/master/R%20Learning%20Activities/LearningActivity-1.Rmd): Introduction to R
- [Learning activity 2](https://github.com/tz33cu/ColumbiaX-Statistical-Thinking-for-Data-Science/blob/master/R%20Learning%20Activities/LearningActivity-2.Rmd): Association 1: analysis of variance
- [Learning activity 3](https://github.com/tz33cu/ColumbiaX-Statistical-Thinking-for-Data-Science/blob/master/R%20Learning%20Activities/LearningActivity-3.Rmd): Association 2: simple linear regression

These learning activities are given during week 3 of our edX course. All these RMarkdown files can be run after installing R, Rstudio, and the knitr package. We use data sets that come with standard R installation. These RMarkdown (rmd) files are intended to be downloaded locally and run on your personal computer. Download these files to your computer and save them in a designated folder (such as one created for this course). To explore the R codes, in Rstudio, use the file menu to open the saved RMarkdown file and click on "knit html".
