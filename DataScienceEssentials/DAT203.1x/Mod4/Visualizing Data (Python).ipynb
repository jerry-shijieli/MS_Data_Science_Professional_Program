Before creating analytical models, a data scientist must develop an understanding of the properties and relationships in a dataset. There are two goals for data exploration and visualization. First to understand the relationships between the data columns. Second to identify features that may be useful for predicting labels in machine learning projects. Additionally, redundant, collinear features can be identified. Thus, visualization for data exploration is an essential data science skill.\nIn this lab you will explore two datasets.\n\nYour first goal is to explore a dataset that includes information about automobiles, which you want to use to create a solution that predicts the price of an automobile based on its characteristics. This type of predictive modeling, in which you attempt to predict a real numeric value, is known as regression; and it will be discussed in more detail later in the course \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for now, the focus of this lab is on visually exploring the data to determine which features may be useful in predicting automobile prices.\n\nAfter exploring the automobile data, you will turn your attention to some adult census data, which you plan to use to classify people as high or low income based information known about them. This technique of predicting whether data entities belong to one class or another is known as classification, and will be discussed later in the course.

You can easily end up with a plot that is not only hard to interpret, but even harder for you to communicate your observations to your colleagues.
